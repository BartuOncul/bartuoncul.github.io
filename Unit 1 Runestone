Pair programming is a successful software development technique where two programmers work together at one computer. One, the driver, types in code while the other, the navigator, gives ideas and feedback. The two coders switch roles frequently. The advantages of pair programming are that two heads are better than one, and pairs usually produce better code with less roadblocks. As future software developers, itâ€™s also important to learn to work in teams.
