The complier will ignore any text between the /* and */ characters.
public class HelloWorld} -------> Class Decleration

Class Decleration) Identifies the name, the start and the end of the class.
(It must be math the file name)

public static void main (String [] args){ ----> Main method

String Literal
--------------
String literal is enclosed in double quotes
A string literal in Java is an exact sequence of charaters (letters, numbers and symbols) which are enclosed in two quotation marks.
For example) "ABC123#Â£" or "1234567"

Syntax/Complier Eror
--------------------
These  erors occur when the code is wrongly typed. (Yazmada hata olursa Syntax/Complier Eror olur.)

Exception
--------
The program attempts to divide a number by 0.

Logic Eror
----------
Example) The programmer accidently uses a minus(-) instead of plus (+) when finding the sum of the numbers.

* A type is set of values (a domain) and a set of operations on them.
* Data type can be categorized as either primitive or referance. (non primitive)
* The primitive data types used in this course define the set of opertaions for numbers and boolean values.

Primitive Data
--------------
boolean ---> True or False
int ----> 2,3,5,7,9
double ----> 2.5, 3.12, 8.2

Primitive data types are generally part of the Java. Except for String, non-primitive types are generally created by the programmer.
Non-primitive types can use mathods to perform actions, but primitive types can not.

What is a Variable?
-------------------
A variable is a name given to a memory location that is holding a specified type of value.

numberOftACOS --> 12
